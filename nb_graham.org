** Anaconda

*** Uninstalling 

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/

anaconda-clean doesn't install properly:

	graham-mac% conda install anaconda-clean
	Fatal Python error: initfsencoding: unable to load the file system codec
	  File "/Users/graham/anaconda/lib/python2.7/encodings/__init__.py", line 123

Seems like it may already be installed.  Just going to run it:

	graham-mac% anaconda-clean
	Delete .anaconda? (Y or N): y
	Delete .bash_profile? (Y or N): n
	Delete .bash_profile-anaconda.bak? (Y or N): n

	Delete .matplotlib? (Y or N): y
	graham-mac% 

Now to delete old anaconda dirs:

	/anaconda3
	/Users/graham/anaconda

*** Reinstalling Anaconda

**** To install Python 2 and 3:

http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/#macos-graphical-install
https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-python.html

Installing Anaconda3, comes with Visual Studio

Having a problem with: "conda search python" and "ipython". 
Switching Terminal to Bash.  Now it works fine.

So far I only have Python 3 installed.  Will try to run network sims in 
Python 3 before bothering with installing 2.7

*** To use Python 2 and 3:

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/switch-environment/

Going to try with just Python 3 for now.

** NEURON

Uninstalling and reinstalling NEURON.

Moving /Applications/NEURON-7.5 to the Desktop (will delete once everything
is working

Getting latest copy of NEURON
https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download

Running gui installer.  Seems to have worked: can run programs from Finder,
but not from command line.

Looking at path:
	graham$ echo $PATH
	/Users/graham/anaconda3/bin:/usr/site/nrniv/local/python/anaconda3/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:/anaconda3/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:/Users/graham/anaconda/bin:/Applications/NEURON-7.4/nrn/x86_64/bin://anaconda/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/texbin:/opt/X11/bin

Okay, my new NEURON is in NEURON-7.6, not NEURON-7.4
Need to update my PATH

https://hathaway.cc/2008/06/how-to-edit-your-path-environment-variables-on-mac/

Editing .bash_profile, changing all 7.4 to 7.6

Now NEURON commands run from command line.


** EEE Network Sims

*** Updating repo:
https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/EEE_network

	graham$ git clone https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/EEE_network.git
	graham$ cd EEE_network/mod/
	graham$ nrnivmodl

Looks good except for ghk.inc:

	Translating NMDAeee.mod into NMDAeee.c
	"/Applications/NEURON-7.6/nrn/x86_64/bin/nocmodl" PlateauConductance
	Couldn't open: ghk.inc
	Couldn't open ghk.inc
	make: *** [NMDAeee.lo] Error 1

Looks like there is no ghk.inc in the mod dir...

	graham$ git clone https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/EEE_network.git
	graham$ cd EEE_network/mod/
	graham$ cp /usr/site/nrniv/local/mod/ghk.inc ./ghk.inc
	graham$ nrnivmodl

Now it seems to have worked fine.  
Will add ghk.inc to the git repo.

But first, I notice I need to merge Salvador's improvements from his
'simplify' branch to the Master... done.

Starting over.

	graham$ rm -rf EEE_network/
	graham$ git clone https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/EEE_network.git
	graham$ cd EEE_network/mod/
	graham$ nrnivmodl

Still has the ghk.inc problem.  Will add to repo.

	graham$ cd ~
	graham$ rm -rf EEE_network/
	graham$ git clone https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/EEE_network.git
	graham$ cd EEE_network/mod/
	graham$ cp /usr/site/nrniv/local/mod/ghk.inc ./ghk.inc
	graham$ git status
	On branch master
	Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

	Untracked files:
	  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

		ghk.inc

	nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
	graham$ git add ghk.inc 
	graham$ git status
	On branch master
	Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

	Changes to be committed:
	  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

		new file:   ghk.inc

	graham$ git commit -m "Added ghk.inc which is needed by NMDAeee.mod"
	[master 5fb1177] Added ghk.inc which is needed by NMDAeee.mod
	 1 file changed, 35 insertions(+)
	 create mode 100644 mod/ghk.inc
	graham$ git push
	Counting objects: 4, done.
	Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
	Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.

	To https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/EEE_network.git
	   700cd24..5fb1177  master -> master

So everything should work now.  Trying it out.

	graham$ cd ~
	graham$ rm -rf EEE_network/
	graham$ git clone https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/EEE_network.git
	graham$ cd EEE_network/mod/
	graham$ nrnivmodl

Works perfectly now.  

Need to symlink mod/x86_64 into eee_network

	graham$ ln -s /Users/graham/EEE_network/mod/x86_64 /Users/graham/EEE_network/eee_network/x86_64

Now hopefully everything works.

*** Running EEE network sim

To debug in Netpyne, run files in the following order:

1) netParams.py 
2) batch_init.py (just init.py in this case) 
3) batch.py

Trying to run netParams.py:
	graham$ python netParams.py 
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "netParams.py", line 1, in <module>
	    from netpyne import specs
	ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'netpyne'

Need to install Netpyne (development version to immediately get fixes):
http://www.netpyne.org/install.html#install-via-pip-development-version

	1. git clone https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne.git
	2. cd netpyne
	3. git checkout development
	4. pip install -e .

	pip will add a symlink in the default python packages folder to the cloned netpyne folder (so you donâ€™t need to modify PYTHONPATH). If new changes are available just need to pull from cloned netpyne repo.

Commands:
	graham$ cd ~/Applications/
	graham$ git clone https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne.git
	graham$ cd netpyne/
	graham$ git checkout development
	graham$ pip install -e .

Everything seems to have worked.

Trying to run netParams again:
	
	graham$ cd ~/EEE_network/eee_network/
	graham$ python netParams.py
	Note: NeuroML import failed; import/export functions for NeuroML will not be available. 
	  To install the pyNeuroML & libNeuroML Python packages visit: https://www.neuroml.org/getneuroml
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "netParams.py", line 95, in <module>
	    for secName,sec in netParams.cellParams['PT5_1']['secs'].iteritems():         
	TypeError: 'Dict' object is not callable

Seems to be a problem with Python 2 --> 3
https://github.com/mgymrek/itable/issues/9
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10458437/what-is-the-difference-between-dict-items-and-dict-iteritems

I changed two `iteritems` in netParams to `items` and now it works.

So netParams works now.  Now to run init.py

	graham$ python init.py

Something's not quite right:

	Plotting raster...
	There was an exception in plotRaster(): 
	 "['tags'] not found in axis" 
	(<class 'KeyError'>, KeyError("['tags'] not found in axis"), <traceback object at 0x12223ea88>)

Also, traces plot appeared in eee_network dir, but it's blank.

Also, there are too few cells...

Line 130 in cfg.py was:
cfg.singleCellPops = True

Changed it to False and trying again.

Running netParams works fine.  
When I run init, it seems like there are no connections and no traces recorded:

	Creating network of 5 cell populations on 1 hosts...
	  Number of cells on node 0: 1500 
	  Done; cell creation time = 4.66 s.
	Making connections...
	  Number of connections on node 0: 0 
	  Done; cell connection time = 0.00 s.
	  Number of stims on node 0: 0 
	  Done; cell stims creation time = 0.00 s.
	Recording 0 traces of 0 types on node 0

Still getting raster error and blank traces plot.


Changing from hpc_slurm to mpi in batch.py:
#setRunCfg(b, type='hpc_slurm')
setRunCfg(b, type='mpi')

Trying to run batch.py

Getting an error:
	graham$ python batch.py
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "batch.py", line 8, in <module>
	    from netpyne.batch import Batch, specs
	ImportError: cannot import name 'specs' from 'netpyne.batch' (/Users/graham/Applications/netpyne/netpyne/batch/__init__.py)

It seems like I should change importing specs from netpyne.batch to just from netpyne...

Changing batch.py and trying again.

Getting a new error:
	FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'batch_data/stim_batch6/stim_batch6_batch.json'

I think the dir must already exist...  Changing batch.py to remove need for
extra dir.

New error:
	Error: invalid runCfg 'type' selected; valid types are 'mpi_bulletin', 'mpi_direct', 'hpc_slurm', 'hpc_torque'

Will have to look into this.  Asked Salva:

	joe [9:59 AM]
	Hey Salva, it seems Netpyne used to accept `mpi` as a runCfg option, but now Netpyne requires `mpi_direct` or `mpi_bulletin`â€¦

	Untitled 
	Error: invalid runCfg 'type' selected; valid types are 'mpi_bulletin', 'mpi_direct', 'hpc_slurm', 'hpc_torque'
	Would you mind explaining the difference between `direct` and `bulletin`?
	i.e. which should I be using?

	salvadord [10:03 AM]
	mpi_bulletin - uses NEURONâ€™s mpi bulletin board (master slave) to run the batch sim â€” there is a master node that sends jobs (each sim) to the slave nodes

	joe [10:05 AM]
	And what does `mpi_direct` do?

	salvadord [10:07 AM]
	mpi_direct - runs each of the batch jobs directly using mpi by calling mpirun via Popen (a pipe) â€” can specify the number of cores of each mpi job â€¦ eg say you have a machine with 16 cores, you could run 4 of the batch jobs on 4 cores each simultaneously
	with mpi_bulleting, each job is always on a single core
	*mpi_bulletin

Okay, so switching to `mpi_bulletin` (seems less complicated):
Changing all `mpi` in batch.py to `mpi_bulletin`

Now batch.py seems to run, but Sergio's default batch was huge: four 
variables each with multiple values.  Will need to set up a smaller batch.  

For now, will look into why there are no connections and no traces.

Running single sim:

graham$ cd ~/EEE_network/eee_network/
graham$ ./runsim

It runs, but no connections or output traces.  Looking into it...

The lack of connectivity is because the connectivity stuff has been commented out. Once we have it working and are getting output we can worry about connectivity.

Having a hard time figuring out the problem with lack of output figures.
I tried adding a soma recording to the cfg file, and when I look in the output json file, the soma trace data is there, but the trace plot output is blank...

Reducing sim time to 50 ms to speed things up.  Commenting out basal trace recording in cfg.

Same thing.  No output traces.

The code is really convoluted.  I'm beginning to think it would be better to start from our cell models and build up network sims from scratch...

Will push my stuff to the git repo now.  Creating a new branch: joes_branch

Cloning, switching to joes_branch, swapping in my changes, then pushing.

** Netpyne Tutorial 5

http://netpyne.org/tutorial.html#position-and-distance-based-connectivity-tutorial-5

Downloaded tut5.py and it runs, though I needed to uncomment the following line to see figures:

	import pylab; pylab.show()  # this line is only necessary in certain systems where figures appear empty

The figures should have been saved as well, but never appeared.  Will look into this later.

Downloaded runsim in order to parallelize sims:
	
	#!/bin/bash
	mpiexec -n $1 nrniv -python -mpi $2  # Run the model

Changed permissions on runsim so I can execute:

	graham$ chmod +x runsim

Now splitting tut5.py into three files: 
	
	netParams.py
	cfg.py
	init.py

Changing runsim to call init.py:

	#!/bin/bash
	# Runs simulation, including MPI.

	numprocesses=$1; if [ -z $numprocesses ]; then numprocesses=4; fi # Number of processes to use
	shift # Eliminate first argument

	mpiexec -np $numprocesses nrniv -python -mpi init.py $@  # Run the model

Copying init.py from earlier network sim:

	"""
	init.py

	Usage:
	    python init.py # Run simulation, optionally plot a raster

	MPI usage:
	    mpiexec -n 4 nrniv -python -mpi init.py

	Contributors: salvadordura@gmail.com
	"""

	#import matplotlib; matplotlib.use('Agg')  # to avoid graphics error in servers
	from netpyne import sim

	simConfig, netParams = sim.readCmdLineArgs()
	#sim.createSimulateAnalyze()

	sim.initialize(
	    simConfig = simConfig,    
	    netParams = netParams)        # create network object and set cfg and net params
	sim.net.createPops()              # instantiate network populations
	sim.net.createCells()             # instantiate network cells based on defined populations
	sim.net.connectCells()            # create connections between cells based on params
	sim.net.addStims()                # add network stimulation
	sim.setupRecording()              # setup variables to record for each cell (spikes, V traces, etc)
	sim.runSim()                      # run parallel Neuron simulation  
	sim.gatherData()                  # gather spiking data and cell info from each node
	sim.saveData()                    # save params, cell info and sim output to file (pickle,mat,txt,etc)
	sim.analysis.plotData()           # plot spike raster etc


Now to break tut5.py into netParams and cfg and try to run.

	graham$ ./runsim 1
	numprocs=1

	>>> 

No figures, and it doesn't seem to have worked:

	Warning: Could not load cfg from command line path or from default cfg.py

It seems the problem may be that in tut5.py we named the config object simConfig instead of cfg...

	simConfig = specs.SimConfig()

Will change all config file lines to:
	
	cfg = specs.SimConfig()

Commenting out line that runs sim in cfg.py

Renaming simConfig to cfg in init.py

Trying to run sim.

	graham$ ./runsim 1

Sim ran successfully, figures appeared but weren't saved.  Off to a good start.

Now that the sim is functional, I'll push to Github.

How I was taught to develop code:
	
	Step 1: make it run.
	Step 2: make it right.
	Step 3: make it fast.

Now to work on Step 2 while ensuring Step 1 continues to work.
